      "Hello, and welcome back! Today we will be diving headfirst into a mind-bending application of the material covered throughout modules 1-4. Before we begin, a caveat: the simulation that we are going to create will not be a <i>fully-adaptive</i> PIC setup; for the sake of time (and not to spoil your possible thesis!) we will be making a number of simplifying assumptions. But more on all of this later, for now, let's get acquainted with the problem."

      "In the field of Plasma Physics, there are a number of incredibly complex phsyical interactions which, to be truthful, aren't fully explained (or, at the very least understood) by modern theories. Because of this, a number of situations arise where visualizing the reaction of particles in a plasma to various stimuli can be difficult, and at worst completely counter-intuitive! This is where the importance of simulations is revealed: in helping modern science process and interpret exactly <i>what the physics says should happen</i> . After all, how can we confirm our results if we can't compare them to anything?"

      "A common method for simulating the motion of particles is the aptly-named \"Particle in Cell\" (PIC) technique, which uses a macro-particle focus on a discrete grid to calculate the problem variables. Because plasma is made up of a mixture of ions, electrons, and neutrals, it is easiest to model the reaction of each species to the specific situation being studied. In most cases, the consideration of magnetic or electric fields can complicate the calculations involved. These fields not only set the particles in motion due to their varied charge (effecting the velocities), but they also vary in strength with the location of each particle within a volume (the particles effect the fields in turn). See now why we can't just ignore the field equations? That's where all of the <b>interesting</b> physics happens! Before getting too bogged down in the minutia of the problem, the first step is to start simple."
